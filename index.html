    <h1 class = "header">Communism vs Capitalism. How has it affected us in 2025?</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The 20th century was shaped by the battle between communism and capitalism, with the battle forming what we now know as the Cold War, the division in Europe, the Korean and Vietnam Wars and shaping the world as we know it today. After WWII, the soviet expansion in Europe triggered the creation of NATO in 1949. The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 - 1953 which divided Korea into north and south, with the south being capitalist and the north communist. This still stands around in 2025.</p>
        <p>The perspective of the two ideologies on each other is that capitalism sees communism as a threat to people's freedom, global peace and prosperity. They believed this due to the brutality of the Russian civil war and that the American government did not want a similar situation on their hands. Meanwhile, communism sees capitalism as a historical necessity, but it is becoming outdated, and a system filled with inequality and alienation, as some would say, it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.</p>
        <p>Some key figures that influenced the battle between capitalism and communism are Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Adam Smith, Harry S. Truman, George F. Kennan, Lech Walesa and Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
        <p><span>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels:</span> These two are both german’s and are known to be the fathers of communism, with how they believed capitalism was a system of class struggle with the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production) against the proletariat (the Working class) they believed this was inherently an exploitative and unstable system that creates alienation and inequality and that this system was bound to fail due to the proletariat (the working class) would cause a civil war.</p>

        <p><span>Joseph Stalin:</span> Was a Russian who is known to be the main enemy of capitalism from around 1920 to the end of his rule in 1953. He was pushing his own version of communism, known as Stalinism. He turned the soviet union into an industrial superpower and also abolished private farms and forced people who were considered enemies of the people to work on them.</p>
        <img src = "Stalin.jpg alt = "Joseph Stalin Picture"">
        <p><span>Mao Zedong:</span> Was a Chinese leader of the People's Republic of China. He turned China into a communist country in 1949 after winning the Chinese Civil War, which is also suspected to be the root cause of the domino effect. His method of power was similar to Stalinism, but it was more radical and harsher on his people.</p>
        <img src = "Zedong.jpg" alt = "Mao Zedong Picture">
        <p><span>Adam Smith:</span> Is known to be the father of modern-day capitalism, which he conceived in 1776. He was a Scottish economist and philosopher, and was also an influential political economist and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment.</p>
        <img src = "Smith.jpg">
        <p><span>Harry S. Truman:</span> Was an American political leader who was in power from 1945 to 1953. He created a policy that stated that the United States would support any country fighting for freedom against authoritarian regimes, like the Korean War, where they supported the South due to its having a less communist ideology.</p>
        <img src = "Truman.jpg">
        <p><span>George F. Kennan</span> Was an American diplomat who had heavily advocated for the pushback of soviet expansion in Europe and Asia. He was heavily against the idea of NATO which was the creation of military power in Europe. Instead he wanted it to be more economical and political than the actions to stop soviet expansion.</p>
        <img src = "Kennan">
        <p><span>Lech Walesa:</span> Is a Polish statesman who helped Poland break free from soviet control when he became the leader of Poland from 1990 to 1995. He was the first democratic politician elected since 1926.</p>
        <img src = "Welesa.jpg">
        <p><span>Mikhail Gorbachev:</span> Was the soviet leader who ultimately caused the fall of the USSR due to his policies called Glasnost and Perestroika. Glasnost was a policy for more government transparency, and perestroika was a policy for restructuring the political system in Russia.</p>
        <p>Overwall capitalism won the battle in the end, with most countries nowadays being capitalist, with only a few communist countries that were established in the mid-20th century, with the most prominent communist countries in 2025 being China, North Korea and Cuba. Around ⅓ of the world's population used to be under communist rule, with only ⅕ of the world's population now, as of 2025.</p>
