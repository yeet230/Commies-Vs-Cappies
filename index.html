        <p>The 20th century was shaped by the battle between communism and capitalism, with the battle forming what we now know as the Cold War, the division in Europe, the Korean and Vietnam Wars and shaping the world as we know it today. After WWII, the soviet expansion in Europe triggered the creation of NATO in 1949. The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 - 1953 which divided Korea into north and south, with the south being capitalist and the north communist. This still stands around in 2025.</p>
        <p>The perspective of the two ideologies on each other is that capitalism sees communism as a threat to people's freedom, global peace and prosperity. They believed this due to the brutality of the Russian civil war and that the American government did not want a similar situation on their hands. Meanwhile, communism sees capitalism as a historical necessity, but it is becoming outdated, and a system filled with inequality and alienation, as some would say, it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.</p>
        <p>Some key figures that influenced the battle between capitalism and communism are Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Adam Smith, Harry S. Truman, George F. Kennan, Lech Walesa and Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
        <p><span>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels:</span> These two are both german’s and are known to be the fathers of communism, with how they believed capitalism was a system of class struggle with the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production) against the proletariat (the Working class) they believed this was inherently an exploitative and unstable system that creates alienation and inequality and that this system was bound to fail due to the proletariat (the working class) would cause a civil war.</p>
